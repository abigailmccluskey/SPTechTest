## Maya McCluskey Kotlin Tech Test
The solution is robust with an MVVM architecture, with care taken to ensure scalability of API and viewmodel.
API service dependency injection with dagger-hilt, album API created with retrofit library. UI created with JetPack Compose.
Code is fully commented in each file. 

The solution is workable however I did not have time to include unit tests, and UI concerns could have been better separated. There are several features that could be implemented including search, filtering and if the API was more robust potentially album art or secondary information when you click a specific album.
